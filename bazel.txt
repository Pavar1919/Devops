**Bazel** is a free and open-source software tool used for the automation of building and testing software ¹²³. It is developed by Google and is used to build and test software of any size and language ¹⁵. Bazel supports projects in multiple languages and builds outputs for multiple platforms ¹⁵. It uses a human-readable, high-level build language and supports large codebases across multiple repositories, and large numbers of users ⁵. 

Here are some key features of Bazel:

- **Fast, Correct, and Flexible**: Bazel is designed to be fast, correct, and flexible, making it an ideal choice for building and testing software of any size and language ¹.
- **Multilingual Magic**         : Bazel supports building and testing using Java, C++, Go, Android, iOS, and many other languages and platforms ¹.
- **Simply Scalable**            : Bazel can scale to handle codebases of any size, whether in multiple repositories or a huge monorepo ¹.
- **Endlessly Extensible**       : Bazel's extension language allows you to add support for new languages and platforms. You can also share and reuse language rules written by the growing Bazel community ¹.

Bazel has a set of commands that are used to manage files and directories in the repository. Here are some of the commonly used commands in Bazel:

- **bazel build**: Builds the specified targets.
- **bazel test**: Runs the specified tests.
- **bazel run**: Runs the specified target.
